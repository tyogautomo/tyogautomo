## Hi there, I'm Yoga 👋
I do a lot of arts stuff before, starting from the traditional arts like hand drawings, paintings.. and digital arts such as vector arts and even 3D modeling.. until one day another cool stuff came into my life => Programming. That thing has been changing my whole life career and making a new point of view of arts (and definetly with others) for me. Yup, everything now can be programmed through lines of codes. Everything i did in the past several years ago now can be more make sense. For example if i want to build a website or mobile apps but i dont have any assets, i could make it for my self-project with Photoshop or AI. Or some of my 3D models now can be imported to Unity 3D to make games with C#. Yeayy so much fun! That's my background why i more interested in Front-End development (but i also learning Back-end to keep up with another technologies).

### TL;DR This is my life in a nut shell..
- 💻 I’m currently working on React Native projects (in a startup company)
- 🚀 I’m currently learning React JS, React Native, and Game Development (C#, Blender, and Unity 3D)
- 💼 I'm currently looking for a job: Web Developer (React JS)
- 🎮 In order to relaxing my brain, i play games with my friends, or just watch some movies
- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - I graduated as a Civil Engineer 👷.
  - I acquainted with programming in my 25 👨‍💻 (which is too old for me, but it was never too late :D)
